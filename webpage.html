    <h1>"I'm mad as hell!"</h1>
<p>Network is a 1976  American satirical film written by Paddy Chayefsky 
and directed by Sidney Lumet, about a fictional television network, UBS, and
its struggle with poor ratings. The film stars Faye Dunaway, William Holden,
Peter Finch, and Robert Duvall and features Wesley Addy, Ned Beatty, and Beatrice 
Straight.</p>
<p>The film won four Academy Awards, in the categories of Best Actor (Finch), 
Best Actress (Dunaway), Best Supporting Actress (Straight), and Best Original 
Screenplay (Chayefsky).
In 2000, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National 
Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". 
In 2002, it was inducted into the Producers Guild of America Hall of Fame as a
film that has "set an enduring standard for U.S. American entertainment".[3] 
In 2006, Chayefsky's script was voted one of the top-ten screenplays by the Writers
Guild of America, East. In 2007, the film was 64th among the 100 greatest American
films as chosen by the American Film Institute, a ranking slightly higher than the 
one AFI had given it ten years earlier.</p>

<p><h2>Plot</h2></p>
<p>The Union Broadcasting System (UBS) is the floundering fourth place American 
network of only four. Howard Beale, the once popular news anchor for UBS, has seen 
his own declining fortunes of late. Personal problems have led to his performance 
slipping, which in turn has led to declining ratings. The network has fired him, 
effective in two weeks, the news given to him by the head of the network's news 
division and his long time friend, Max Schumacher. On his first broadcast following
receiving this news, Beale announces on air that he will blow out his brains on the 
telecast in one week's time, and the reason for doing so. The network brass, incensed,
pulls him off effective immediately, but Howard, stating he was drunk at the time over
the news of his firing, pleads for one final telecast so that he can exit from news
broadcasting with dignity. When on the broadcast Howard instead speaks candidly, 
emotionally and profanely about what he is feeling, Diana Christensen, the relatively 
new and ambitious vice-president in charge of programming, thinks that Howard is the
panacea to all the network's rating problems as Howard is only stating what the public
is feeling. She is interested in counter-establishment programming. With Max's blessing,
she wants to hijack from the news division a television news show featuring Howard. 
Through this process, Diana tries to convince network brass to do what she wants not 
only with Howard's show but other counter-establishment programming, Max wants to 
preserve his reputation as a news man with integrity, and Howard tries to convince 
Max and Diana that he is imbued with messages from higher powers, which is making 
him seem insane to Max (who cares) and Diana (who cares only if his rantings from
these higher powers increase ratings). Despite their differences in views, Max and 
Diana begin a September-May romance, which plays on Max's conscience as a faithful
married man for twenty-five years and which Diana always refers to, as she does
everything in life, in terms of a television show plot outline.</p>
